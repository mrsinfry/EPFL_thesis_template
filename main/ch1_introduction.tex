\section{AlScN as the material of the future}
Since the beginning of the decade Aluminum-Scandium Nitride became more and more a common buzzword in scientific publications. The main reasons behind the increased interest on this novel materials are two: IC fabrication compatibility and most importantly increased piezoelectric coupling. 


\section{Material properties }
The first occurrency of an alloying of aluminum and scandium was in 1971 \cite{caro_piezoelectric_2015} and its first application was to improve the strain resistance of Al in aeronautics application. With the advent of miniaturisation in FR front-ends the bulky Quartz crystal started to be replace by MEMS-based resonator such as SAW, BAW, or CMR. The reason being that MEMS devices have a higher throughput and a lower footprint than quartz crystals, allowing for batch fabrication and integrability, still keeping the higher Q that mechanical systems show compared to LC tanks. In parallel to the architecture evolution of RF MEMS
