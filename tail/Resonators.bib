	abstract = {This paper demonstrates a new class of AlN-based piezoelectric resonators for operation in the microwave frequency range. These novel devices are identified as cross-sectional-Lamé-mode resonators (CLMRs) as they rely on the piezoelectric transduction of a Lamé mode, in the cross section of an AlN plate. Such a 2-D mechanical mode of vibration, characterized by motion along both the lateral and the thickness directions, is actuated and sensed piezoelectrically through the coherent combination of the e31and e33piezoelectric coefficients of AlN. This special feature enables the implementation of CLMRs with high values of electromechanical coupling coefficient. In particular, we experimentally demonstrated kt2values in excess of 4.6\% and 2.5\% in CLMRs using, respectively, two or one metallic interdigitated metallic electrodes, and operating around 1 and 2.8 GHz. Furthermore, despite the dependence of the cross-sectional Lamé mode on both the thickness and the width of the AlN plate, lithographic tunability of the resonance frequency, by changing only the in-plane dimensions of the device, can be achieved without a substantial degradation of kt2. The capability of achieving high kt2and multiple operating frequencies on the same chip, without additional fabrication costs (lithographic tunability of the resonance frequency), makes this technology one of the best candidates for the implementation of multifrequency and low insertion loss filter banks for reconfigurable radiofrequency front ends.},

It is observed that ring-shaped piezoelectric contour-mode MEMS resonators satisfy this design criterion than in case of rectangular plate MEMS resonators. Also ring-shaped contourmode piezoelectric MEMS resonator has an advantage that its fundamental frequency is defined by in-plane dimensions, but they show variation of fundamental frequency with different Platinum (Pt) thickness referred as change in ratio of ݂ோௐΤ݂௢. This paper presents the effects of variation in geometrical parameters and change in piezoelectric material on the resonant frequencies of Platinum piezoelectric-Aluminium ring-shaped contour-mode MEMS resonators and its electrical parameters. The proposed structure with Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) as the piezoelectric material was observed to be a piezoelectric material with minimal change in fundamental resonant frequency due to Platinum thickness variation. This structure was also found to exhibit extremely low motional resistance of 0.03  as compared to the 3135  range obtained when using AlN as the piezoelectric material.

A high-quality 0.7 μm X-cut LN thin film atop a 2 μm SiO2 compensation layer was used to form the body of the proposed resonator based on a quasi-fundamental shear horizontal (Q-SH0) plate wave with acoustic propagation in 170° rotated from the Y-axis. The proposed LN-SiO2 resonator is suspended through 5-μm narrow-width supporting beams to mitigate the acoustic energy loss to the substrate, thus exhibiting a best-case Q of 3,900 in vacuum with keff2 {\textgreater} 3.8\% (FOM = keff2 ×Q {\textgreater} 148). The closed-loop oscillator was demonstrated with a commercial phase-locked loop (Zurich HF2LI PLL) under a loop bandwidth of 90 kHz. Measured phase noise for the 40-MHz LN-S1O2 Q-SH0 wave oscillator at 1 kHz and 10 kHz offsets is -110 dBc/Hz and -123 dBc/Hz, respectively, with a minimal bias instability of only 6.2 ppb.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we analyze possible sources of dissipation in aluminium nitride (AlN) contour mode resonators for three different resonance frequency devices (fr) (220 MHz, 370 MHz, and 1.05 GHz). For this purpose, anchors of different widths (Wa) and lengths (La) proportional to the acoustic wavelength (λ) are designed as supports for resonators in which the dimensions of the vibrating body are kept fixed. The Q extracted experimentally confirms that anchor losses are the dominant source of damping for most anchor designs when fr is equal to 220 and 370 MHz. For specific anchor dimensions (Wa/λ is in the range of 1/4-1/2) that mitigate energy leakage through the supports, a temperature-dependent dissipation mechanism dominates as seen in higher fr resonators operating close to 1.05 GHz. To describe the Q due to anchor losses, we use a finite-element method with absorbing boundary conditions. We also propose a simple analytical formulation for describing the dependence of the temperature-dependent damping mechanism on frequency. In this way, we are able to quantitatively predict Q due to anchor losses and qualitatively describe the trends observed experimentally.},

	abstract = {Gallium nitride (GaN) is a wide bandgap semiconductor material and is the most popular material after silicon in the semiconductor industry. The prime movers behind this trend are LEDs, microwave, and more recently, power electronics. New areas of research also include spintronics and nanoribbon transistors, which leverage some of the unique properties of GaN. GaN has electron mobility comparable with silicon, but with a bandgap that is three times larger, making it an excellent candidate for high-power applications and high-temperature operation. The ability to form thin-AlGaN/GaN heterostructures, which exhibit the 2-D electron gas phenomenon leads to high-electron mobility transistors, which exhibit high Johnson's figure of merit. Another interesting direction for GaN research, which is largely unexplored, is GaN-based micromechanical devices or GaN microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). To fully unlock the potential of GaN and realize new advanced all-GaN integrated circuits, it is essential to cointegrate passive devices (such as resonators and filters), sensors (such as temperature and gas sensors), and other more than Moore functional devices with GaN active electronics. Therefore, there is a growing interest in the use of GaN as a mechanical material. This paper reviews the electromechanical, thermal, acoustic, and piezoelectric properties of GaN, and describes the working principle of some of the reported high-performance GaN-based microelectromechanical components. It also provides an outlook for possible research directions in GaN MEMS.},

	shorttitle = {After 60 years},
	doi = {10.1109/ULTSYM.2008.0105},
	abstract = {A new formulation for computing the unloaded quality factor (Q) of a resonator or of any terminated electromagnetic or piezoelectric cavity from its measured S parameters is proposed. This formulation, based on the work of Dicke, and Bode, computes Q at a continuum of frequencies from below the resonant frequency (fs) to above the anti-resonant frequency (fp). Sixty years ago Dicke and Beringer derived a pair of formulations for Q in terms of the measured impedance (Z) and admittance (Y). The new formulation has two important advantages over Dicke's formulations: (1) Even for resonators that are free of spurious resonances - whose S-parameters are near ideal – Dicke's Z and Y based formulations yield erroneous Q values over a range of frequencies (called ldquodead zonesrdquo) in the vicinity of the frequencies at which the functions Z and Y are singular (at fp and fs respectively). Since the S parameters of such an ideal resonator do not have any singularities, the new Q formulation provides reliable Q values over the full range of frequencies. (2) For non-ideal resonators exhibiting spurious lateral-mode resonances in certain frequency ranges, both the new and Dicke formulations report Q values that are clearly erroneous since they oscillate from positive to negative. Dicke does not explain why his formulation breaks down in such regions nor have we found such an explanation in the literature. In contrast to this, this work explains why the S parameter based Q formula is invalidated over regions of frequency space in which ln(mag(S)) fluctuates wildly. We show that in such regions that pre-conditioning of the S-parameter data with a Gaussian window average is useful in yielding a meaningful value for Q. We propose that the S parameter based Q formulation, being devoid of ldquodead zonesrdquo should be used as a standard by which piezoelectric resonators fabricated in different technologies e.g. FBAR, SAW, BAW be compared.},

A low 2.14 dB insertion loss is demonstrated for a length extensional, PZT-on-2-μm-silicon 15 MHz resonator. A 22 dB return loss and maximum unloaded quality factor, QUL, max, of 540 in air resulted for this resonator. Similar performances with a QUL, max of 2850 are also demonstrated with a PZT fabricated on 10-μm-silicon device. The competing effects of decreased motional resistance and increased transducer capacitances with increased transduction area are addressed through analytical models and experimental results. Additionally, a third order length extensional mode piezoelectric resonator with asymmetric input and output electrodes were also designed to assess its potential performance as a piezoelectric resonant transformer; a 2.1× voltage boost is demonstrated for a 14.7 MHz extensional mode resonator.},

	abstract = {Due to their high Q and temperature-stable properties, quartz crystal oscillators are important clock sources in consumer, commercial, industrial, and military products for many years. The demand for quartz crystals and crystal oscillators has been increasing steadily between 4 and 10\% annually since the ldquodotcomrdquo market collapse in 2000 2001. The total market for 2008 is expected to exceed \$4.1B. The quartz crystal and crystal oscillator industry has made major progresses in miniaturization, performance enhancement, and cost reduction in the past ten years. The unique fabrication and encapsulation requirements though render quartz crystals and crystal oscillators difficult or close to impossible to be integrated onto the silicon-based IC platforms. The recent strong marketing push of the all silicon MEMS resonators and oscillators seemed to re-ignite the interest in displacing the quartz crystal technology and to open up again the prospect in clock source integration. Based on a 2006 review paper,[1] the author expands on the subject by reviewing the development of the all silicon MEMS oscillators and crystal oscillators in the past few years and commenting on what challenges they face in the highly competitive frequency control products industry. Since information on the technical development of the all silicon MEMS oscillators and crystal oscillators is abundantly and readily available, this paper addresses more on the market and business aspects. This paper also touches on the recent development of piezoelectric-activated silicon MEMS resonators and oscillators and all silicon oscillators (with no moving parts).},

	doi = {10.1109/I2MTC.2017.7969903},
	abstract = {Microwave resonators are of widespread use in technological applications as well as in many research fields. In all cases, as microwave filters or as material characterisation devices or as sensors, their use requires the accurate measurement of their quality factor Q and resonance frequency ν0, which are the main parameters shaping their response. The most accurate measurements are obtained through a full determination of all the complex scattering coefficients Sij of a two-port coupled resonator, through a Vector Network Analyzer, and subsequent fitting in the complex plane. These approaches allow also to compensate for resonator non-idealities which alter the resonator response and thus impact on Q and ν0 accuracies. On the other hand, cost effective and fast measurement setups rely on power sensors which allow scalar measurements only. In these cases, the resonator ideal response takes the shape of a lorentzian curve. It is therefore of interest to optimise the fitting strategy of scalar measurements in order to obtain the better fit goodness and robustness against perturbations. In this work we study the most common sources of perturbation and their models, in order to assess which fitting strategy yields the best results when the perturbation cause is not known a-priori. We perform both numerical simulations and tests on actual experimental data. We find that the fit model describing a cross-coupling between two resonator ports is the most robust approach.},

Moreover, we assess the electromechanical coupling and the maximum achieved quality factor from 150 to 500 MHz. In comparison to pure aluminum nitride (AlN) CMRs, our results show electromechanical coupling coefficients of more than a 2× factor higher at around 200 MHz. The highest quality factor is measured on a CMR operating at 388 MHz and is in excess of 1600. From the characterization of devices operating at different frequencies, material parameters of the Al0.83Sc0.17N are extracted such as the stiffness constant, the relative permittivity, and the piezoelectric constant. In particular, the reported d31 piezoelectric constant is equal to -3.9 pm/V. This represents a 2.25× improvement when compared to pure AlN. Finally, we report the first temperature compensation experimental results for Al0.83Sc0.17N CMRs. Our results show that about 1.5 μm of sputtered oxide, deposited on top of a released resonator, allows near zero temperature coefficient of frequency variation for CMRs operating up to 500 MHz.},

	abstract = {This paper reports on 2.75 GHz wideband acoustically coupled thickness-extensional filters with large bandwidth tunability realized in aluminum-scandium-nitride (Al0.7Sc0.3N) films. Molybdenum interdigitated transducers (IDT) are patterned on 1μm-thick Al0.7Sc0.3N film to realize acoustically coupled bandpass filters at 2.75 GHz with -3dB bandwidths (BW-3dB) ranging over 101.4 MHz to 218 MHz, and insertion loss of {\textasciitilde}3.6dB. Benefiting from the large electromechanical coupling (kt2) of the Al0.7Sc0.3N, acoustically coupled filters with {\textasciitilde}5 times larger bandwidth compared to AlN counterparts can be achieved. Furthermore, the large kt2 along with the ferroelectric characteristic of Al0.7Sc0.3N enables large BW-3dB tunability of {\textasciitilde}24.3 MHz and center frequency tunability of {\textasciitilde}15 MHz by application of {\textasciitilde}60 volts, DC, using bias-tee. The acoustically coupled filter architecture provides superior merits compared to conventional electrically coupled filters (i.e. lattice, ladder, etc.) including the lithographical bandwidth definition through proper IDT patterning, and realization of the filter in a single monolithic structure and smaller form factor. Such high-performance filters enable realization of reconfigurable RF front-end for emerging multi-band wireless systems that require extensive compatibility with a wide variety of communication standards in the forthcoming 5G landscape.},

Using this approach, a theoretical filter is designed with an insertion loss of 6.65 dB and a fractional bandwidth of 0.11\% when connected to a port impedance of 3 kΩ {\textbar}{\textbar} 250 fF with a temperature coefficient of frequency of less than 2 ppm/K. The fabricated device shows an insertion loss of 11.5 dB and a fractional bandwidth of 0.13\%.},

	abstract = {Self-sustained oscillators are ubiquitous and essential for metrology, communications, time reference, and geolocation. In its most basic form an oscillator consists of a resonator driven on-resonance, through feedback, to create a periodic signal sustained by a static energy source. The generation of a stable frequency, the basic function of oscillators, is typically achieved by increasing the amplitude of motion of the resonator while remaining within its linear, harmonic, regime. Contrary to this conventional paradigm, in this Letter we show that by operating the oscillator at special points in the resonator’s anharmonic regime we can overcome fundamental limitations of oscillator performance due to thermodynamic noise as well as practical limitations due to noise from the sustaining circuit. We develop a comprehensive model that accounts for the major contributions to the phase noise of the nonlinear oscillator. Using a nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS)-based oscillator, we experimentally verify the existence of a special region in the operational parameter space that enables a significant reduction of the oscillator’s phase noise, as predicted by our model.},

The fundamental mode is measured at a resonance frequency of 9.8 MHz. The second and the third higher order harmonics are observed when the resonator is excited at its fundamental flexural mode in the nonlinear region. A varying AC voltage drives the resonator from the linear regime into non-linear regime for an applied DC bias of 80 V.

There are methods that exist to mitigate this problem by extracting the multipath parameters. One method is to transmit a narrow pulse and extract the multipath parameters from the impulse response of the channel. Another wellestablished method is to use frequency dependent amplitude fading of a swept sinusoid for multipath parameters extraction. In this paper, we used the second technique for the suppression of multipath distortion. We implemented this scheme with Ettus B120 software defined radio (SDR) and observed more than a factor of 8 (18 dB) reduction of multipath distortion under different indoor environments; our findings are supported by both simulation as well as experimental results.},

The system was tested by serializing a 100x50pixels image in a bit stream and transmitting over the intrabody link. The sampling rate was set at twice the bandwidth of the pMUTs based on the Nyquist theorem. The detected Bit Error Rate (BER) was 1E-4 and 1E-1 for short and long range respectively, demonstrating the functionality of the pMUT intrabody transceiver.

By carefully examining the TCf of the different resonant modes, we can gain insight into the temperature stability of the material and the structure, and engineer devices with desired TCf on different modes, on which certain modes can act as temperature sensor and facilitate the compensation mechanism for the temperature-insensitive modes to achieve highly stable output.},

Then, a nonlinear cost function is established to guarantee the lithography imaging performance on the downsampled layout. Under the sparsity assumption of the mask, the OPC problem is formulated as an inverse nonlinear CS reconstruction problem. The iterative hard thresholding (IHT) algorithm is then used to solve for the OPC problem. The proposed method proves to improve the computational eﬃciency of traditional gradient-based OPC methods, while improving the process windows of the lithography systems. Beneﬁting from the sparse property of the mask patterns, the mask manufacturability can also be improved compared to traditional methods.},

	abstract = {In this work, we present the low-loss acoustic delay lines (ADLs) at 5 GHz, using the first-order antisymmetric (A1) mode in 128° Y-cut lithium niobate thin films. The ADLs use a single-phase unidirectional transducer (SPUDT) design with a feature size of quarter acoustic wavelength. The design space is analytically explored and experimentally validated. The fabricated miniature A1 ADLs with a feature size of 0.45 μm show a high operating frequency at 5.4 GHz, a minimum insertion loss (IL) of 3 dB, a fractional bandwidth (FBW) of 1.6\%, and a small footprint of 0.0074 mm². The low IL and high operating frequency have significantly surpassed the state-of-the-art performance of ADLs. The propagation characteristics of A1 acoustic waves have also been extracted. The demonstrated designs can lead to low-loss and high-frequency transversal filters for future 5G applications in the sub-6-GHz bands.},

	abstract = {In this study, a novel method of measuring the Quality Factor (Q) of a MEMS tuning fork resonator at low temperature enabled us to accurately pinpoint the energy dissipation resulting from anchor damping [1]. We used this new method to perform the first direct examination of the impact of design of the anchors and the die mounting structures on the strength of anchor damping. Our results show that the elastic energy can escape the resonator through the anchor(s), and still be retained within the die, and that energy stored in the die can return to the resonator. Thus, the measured Q of the resonator is increased, depending on mounting structures far from the resonating element. Moreover, our data shows that the number of anchors does not change the total energy dissipation through the anchors.},

	title = {Engineered acoustic mismatch for anchor loss control in contour mode resonators},
	abstract = {Improving the quality factor (Q) of electromechanical resonators is of paramount importance for different applications, ranging from RF ﬁltering to sensing. In this paper, we present a modiﬁed fabrication process ﬂow for contour mode resonators to simultaneously obtain the (i) Q insensitive to the Si undercut geometry and (ii) in-phase reﬂectors for anchor loss control and Q optimization. To assess the potential of the reﬂector, we vary its distance from the resonator’s anchor. This results in a periodic trend of Q when the distance between the anchor and the reﬂector changes. Further conﬁrmation of the trend is obtained via a ﬁnite element (FE) model. Interestingly, when in the FE model, the step between consecutive reﬂectors is decreased by a factor of 6Â with respect to the experimental step, we observe a fast modulation of Q, superimposed onto that seen experimentally. The origin of this fast modulation is likely the coexistence of waves with different wavelengths traveling through the released region. Our results show that the proﬁle of the region undergoing Si undercutting (released area) can be easily set by design. Furthermore, engineering the introduced acoustic mismatch provides unprecedented control of anchor loss.},

These resonators achieve the lowest value of motional resistance ever reported for contour-mode resonators and combine it with high Q factors, therefore enabling the fabrication of arrays of high-performance microresonators with different frequencies on a single chip. Uncompensated temperature coefficients of frequency of approximately -25 ppm/degC were also recorded for these resonators.

	abstract = {Sputter deposited AlScN films with an Sc content of 38 at. \% were investigated by X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy to study the influence of the radio frequency (RF) bias on the growth of abnormally oriented grains (AOG). Scanning electron microscopy investigations showed that the nucleation and growth of AOGs occurs with applied negative RF-bias till 4 W (51 mW/cm2), while the complete loss of AOGs happens at biases larger than 6 W (76 mW/cm2). The lack of AOGs within the film occurs together with the loss of the preferred (0001)-texture. At high bias powers, the (0001)-texture nucleates due to the strong (111)-texture of Pt-layer, but grain orientation becomes random during growth. The change of film microstructure with higher biases is reflected in the decay of piezoelectric properties. The concentration of trapped Ar atoms into the films increased with increasing bias power. The variation of the Ar-content along the film cross-section was ascribed to RF bias instabilities.},
