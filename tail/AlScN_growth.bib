	doi = {10.1109/ULTSYM.2017.8092076},
	abstract = {This paper reports on the investigation of 1 μm thick films of 20\% Scandium-doped Aluminum Nitride (ScAlN) for the making of piezoelectric MEMS laterally vibrating resonators (LVRs). The ScAlN films, which can be sputter-deposited such as undoped Aluminum Nitride (AlN) films, were used to demonstrate high performance resonators. These devices showed quality factor (Qs) in excess of 1000 in air centered around 250 and 500 MHz and enhanced electromechanical coupling (kt2) in the range of 3.2-4.5\%. This kt2is double the value of what has been achieved on similar resonators made out of AlN films. A 3-dB Qsof 1300 has been recorded both for 1-port and 2-port resonators at 250 and 500 MHz, while a maximum Qsof 1500 has been recorded for a 1-port resonator at 500 MHz. Along with experimental results from actual devices, this work also reports the etching characteristics of the piezoelectric material under Cl2/BCl3chemistry to attain high selectivity and straight sidewall with a SiO2hard mask. More broadly, enhancement of resonators design and fabrication process, suppression of spurious modes and increase in the concentration of Sc (theoretically up to 40\%) will lead to significant performance improvements for many classes of piezoelectric MEMS, especially tunable filters.},

	abstract = {Electromechanical coupling coefficient kt2 is one of the important parameters to estimate performance of BAW filters. The resonance-antiresonance method according to IEEE standard is common method to determine kt2. However, this method requires a self-standing film structure (FBAR). In this study, we propose the kt2 estimation method for a film/substrate structure (HBAR). This method allows us to estimate kt2 for as grown wafers without removing substrates. The lattice strains of piezoelectric crystals are induced when electric field are applied. The strains can be measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Therefore, the kt2 of the film is expected to be indirectly determined by the use of piezoelectric equations. The values of kt2 determined by this method were compared with the resonance-antiresonance method and the conversion loss method.},

	abstract = {Aluminium nitride (AlN) is a promising material for challenging sensor applications such as process monitoring in harsh environments (e.g., turbine exhaust), due to its piezoelectric properties, its high temperature stability and good thermal match to silicon. Basically, the operational temperature of piezoelectric materials is limited by the increase of the leakage current as well as by enhanced diffusion effects in the material at elevated temperatures. This work focuses on the characterization of aluminum nitride thin films after post deposition annealings up to temperatures of 1000 °C in harsh environments. For this purpose, thin film samples were temperature loaded for 2 h in pure nitrogen and oxygen gas atmospheres and characterized with respect to the film stress and the leakage current behaviour. The X-ray diffraction results show that AlN thin films are chemically stable in oxygen atmospheres for 2 h at annealing temperatures of up to 900 °C. At 1000 °C, a 100 nm thick AlN layer oxidizes completely. For nitrogen, the layer is stable up to 1000 °C. The activation energy of the samples was determined from leakage current measurements at different sample temperatures, in the range between 25 and 300 °C. Up to an annealing temperature of 700 °C, the leakage current in the thin film is dominated by Poole-Frenkel behavior, while at higher annealing temperatures, a mixture of different leakage current mechanisms is observed.},

We report composition-dependent values of piezoelectric coefﬁcients eij , piezoelectric moduli dij and elastic constants Cij . The theoretical ﬁndings are complemented with experimental measurement of e33 for a series of sputtered ScAlN ﬁlms carried out with a piezoelectric resonator. The rapid increase with Sc content of the piezoelectric response reported in previous studies is conﬁrmed for the available data. A detailed description of the full methodology required to calculate the piezoelectric properties of ScAlN, with application to other complex alloys, is presented. In particular, we ﬁnd that the large amount of internal strain present in ScAlN and its intricate relation with electric polarization make conﬁgurational sampling and the use of large supercells at different compositions necessary in order to accurately derive the piezoelectric response of the material.},

Additionally, the mass density and piezoelectric coeﬃcient were determined even up to x ¼ 0:42. Two sets of 1 μm-thick AlScN(0001) thin ﬁlms were deposited on Si(001) using reactive pulsed-DC magnetron cosputtering. One set of thin ﬁlms was used to determine the a- and c- lattice parameters and the eﬀective relative dielectric coeﬃcient ε33,f , using X-ray diﬀraction and capacitive measurements, respectively. Lattice parameters were then used to extract average internal parameter u, bond length, and bond angle, as well as mass density, as a function of Sc concentration. Density functional theory calculations were performed to provide the equilibrium lattice parameters a, c, and u, as well as the bond angle and the bond lengths for wurtzite-AlN and layered hexagonal-ScN. The second set of ﬁlms was used to fabricate surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonators with wavelengths λ from 2 up to 24 μm. The SAW dispersion in conjunction with ﬁnite element modeling ﬁtting was used to extract the elastic stiﬀness as well as the piezoelectric coeﬃcients. The overall evolution of the material parameters and the change of the crystal structure as a function of Sc concentration is discussed in order to provide a possible explanation of the observed behavior.},

	abstract = {It is more difficult to nucleate AlN-ScN alloy thin films (AlScN) in pure (0001)-texture than it is with pure AlN thin films. AlN thus can serve as seed layer for AlScN. Equipment limitations may lead to the problem of a vacuum break between AlN and AlScN deposition, as it leads to oxidation of the AlN surface. This issue was studied with high resolution TEM and electron diffraction. The formed oxide layer disturbed a lot the epitaxial growth, leading to additional grain orientations. A mild RF etching step introduced before AlScN deposition was able to remove the oxide layer, and allowed for growing Al0.84Sc0.16N in local epitaxy on AlN, as shown by Hyper map EDX images. The resulting AlScN films show a pure (0001) texture. Double beam laser interferometry and finite element modeling were used to determine d33, f of both layers together as 6.6 pm/V, and of 6.85 pm/V for AlScN alone when using the standard value of 3.9 pm/V for pure AlN. At the same time, the relative dielectric constant of Al0.84Sc0.16N was determined as 14.1.},

Consequently, there is increasing interest in the epitaxial growth of high-quality AlScN/GaN heterostructures. So far, only very recent reports on AlScN HEMT structures grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) have been published. Herein, the motivation for depositing AlScN epitaxial layers by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) as well as the challenges associated with this approach are explained. For the first time, the successful deposition of epitaxial layers with a Sc content up to 30\% (Al0.7Sc0.3N) is reported. It is shown that the deposited films consist of wurtzite-type AlScN with high crystalline quality, demonstrating that MOCVD is suitable for the growth of HEMT structures with Sc-based ternary nitrides.},

The results of X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, and field emission scanning electron microscopy show that the orientation of AlN films depends on the kinds of substrate metals evidently. The differences of AlN films deposited on various metal electrodes are attributed to the differences in lattice mismatch and thermal expansion coefficient between the AlN material and substrate metals. The AlN film deposited on the Pt/Ti electrode reveals highly the c-axis orientation with well-textured columnar structure. The positive role of the Pt/Ti electrode in achieving the high-quality AlN films and high-performance film bulk acoustic resonator (FBAR) may be attributed to the smaller lattice mismatch as well as the similarity of thermal expansion coefficient between the deposited AlN material and the Pt/Ti electrode substrate.},

Lead zirconium titanate (PZT) ceramics are high-performance piezoelectric materials, which are widely used in sensors, actuators and other electronic devices; they contain more than 60 weight per cent lead. Although there has been a concerted effort to develop lead-free piezoelectric ceramics, no effective alternative to PZT has yet been found1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14. Here we report a lead-free piezoelectric ceramic with an electric-field-induced strain comparable to typical actuator-grade PZT. We achieved this through the combination of the discovery of a morphotropic phase boundary in an alkaline niobate-based perovskite solid solution, and the development of a processing route leading to highly 〈001〉 textured polycrystals. The ceramic exhibits a piezoelectric constant d33 (the induced charge per unit force applied in the same direction) of above 300 picocoulombs per newton (pC N-1), and texturing the material leads to a peak d33 of 416 pC N-1. The textured material also exhibits temperature-independent field-induced strain characteristics.},

	abstract = {Micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS) have long shown their potential to disrupt the established technologies. Over the past 15 years, MEMS have become fundamental components in filters, accelerometers, gyroscopes and gas sensors. MEMS are now an essential part of most of the electronic devices we own. However, their smaller counterpart, NEMS, are still far from industrialization due to two challenges: their fabrication and the transduction of their motion.
One transduction technique to control the motion of NEMS is piezoelectricity, which can be directly integrated, has low power consumption and exhibits linear transduction. Piezoelectric aluminum nitride (AlN) deposited by reactive sputtering has been applied in several MEMS applications and recently in NEMS. There is a good understanding of the sputtering parameters and substrate conditions needed to fabricate high quality micrometer thick AlN films, but less is known for nanometer thick films.
One part of the thesis was focused on the impact of reactive sputtering parameters and substrate conditions on the c-axis texture and piezoelectric coefficients of 50-100 nm thick AlN films. We found that substrate temperature, sputtering power and type as well as quality of substrate have a strong impact on AlN c-axis texture. By optimizing these conditions, we were able to fabricate 50 nm thick AlN films with crystalline and piezoelectric properties similar to micrometer thick films. Recently, AlN doped with scandium (AlScN) has been developed due to its larger piezoelectric coefficients compared to undoped AlN. We found a strong influence of two sputtering parameters, argon gas concentration and substrate bias, on the c-axis texture and density of abnormal grains in 1 micrometer thick Al0.6Sc0.4N films.
A fundamental issue in piezoelectric NEMS is that an asymmetric thickness cross section is necessary to create a flexural curvature and the asymmetry will reduce with decreasing system thickness. To avoid this issue, an alternative transduction technique based on flexoelectricity can be implemented, which has three advantages over piezoelectricity: it is theorized to exist in all dielectrics, it is predicted that its coefficients do not decrease with decreasing film thickness and any thickness cross section can be used to fabricate flexural NEMS.
Most experimental work in flexoelectricity has been on ferroelectric or paraelectric materials; little research has been conducted on materials like CMOS-compatible, high-k dielectrics which could replace piezoelectric thin films in NEMS. Therefore, another part of this thesis focused on the fabrication and characterization of flexoelectric actuators based on amorphous hafnium oxide (HfO2). The fabricated 40 nm thick HfO2 films were non-ferroelectric and an effective flexoelectric coefficient of 37 pC/m was measured.
The final part of the thesis analyzed the potential curvature generation of piezoelectric and flexoelectric films with nanoscale thicknesses, as well as provided a better understanding of the relationship between experimental flexoelectric coefficients and relative permittivity. Based on these analyses, we envision that flexoelectric thin films based on high-k dielectric materials with relative permittivities between 50-100 are a promising alternative to piezoelectric thin films in nanoscale actuation.},

In contrast to AlN films, which crystallinity typically improves with increasing film thickness due to growth of more thorough grains, Al0.7Sc0.3N texture degrades in thicker films. Technological solutions for smooth and highly c-axis oriented Al0.7Sc0.3N films were defined and tested. Introduction of AlN seed layer and deposition at low gas pressure remarkably suppressed growth of abnormal grains and improved crystallinity of the films. Highly c-axis oriented films with RC FWHM of 1.6° and surface roughness RMS of 2.3 nm were grown on Si as well as on Mo electrodes.},

	abstract = {Reactive pulsed DC magnetron co-sputtering is used to grow piezoelectric aluminum nitride (AlN) and aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN) thin films on Si(001) substrates. By using grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), we investigate how the microstructure and the presence of misoriented grains affect the piezoelectric properties of the material. N2 concentration and target-to-substrate distance are finely tuned to achieve thin films without misoriented grains, resulting in Al0.87Sc0.13N thin films with low roughness, high degree of c-axis orientation, homogenous polarity, and piezoelectric coefficient d33 = −12.3 pC/N.},
