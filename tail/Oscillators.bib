	abstract = {Through theoretical deduction, two new explanations of Leeson model are presented: the corner frequency of high \textit{Q} oscillators in the phase noise curve should be the frequency at the intersection of the \textit{f}$^{\textrm{0}}$ curve segment after adding 3 dB and the \textit{f}$^{\textrm{-1}}$ curve segment; \textit{f}$_{\textrm{0}}$\textit{/}2\textit{Q}$_{\textrm{L}}$ of low \textit{Q} oscillators in the phase noise curve should also be the frequency at the intersection of the \textit{f}$^{\textrm{0}}$ curve segment after adding 3 dB and the \textit{f}$^{\textrm{-2}}$ curve segment. Moreover, these two new explanations were verified by the experimental data of a reported 80 MHz high \textit{Q} quartz crystal oscillator and a reported low \textit{Q} lithium tantalate (LiTaO$_{\textrm{3}}$) oscillator, respectively. The results could help researchers and engineers properly estimate the key parameters of oscillator phase noise.},

	abstract = {A new mathematical method is proposed to convert the oscillator instability parameters from Allan variance to Spectrum Density (SD) of random phase fluctuations, which is the inversion of the classic transformation formula from SD to Allan variance. Due to the fact that Allan variance does not always determine a unique SD function, Power-law model of the SD of oscillator phase fluctuations is introduced to the translating algorithm. And that a constrained maximum likelihood solution is presented. Considering that the inversion is an ill-posed problem, a regularization method is brought forward in the process. Simulation results show that the converted SD of phase fluctuations from Allan variance parameters agrees well with the real SD function. Furthermore, the effects of the selected regularization factors and the input Allan variances are analyzed in detail.},

	abstract = {Reference oscillators are crucial hardware components of radio-frequency receiver circuits, as their performance directly affects the system performance. Especially in GHz applications, such as 4G/5G mobile communications, a low error-vector magnitude is required, which is strongly influenced by the phase noise of the reference oscillator. This paper reports the results of the design, simulation, and measurement of a MEMS oscillator with very low phase noise. Therefore, it is suitable for use as reference oscillator operating at high frequencies in RF receiver systems. While the MEMS device is a plate-shaped contour-mode resonator in an aluminium-nitride-on-silicon technology, the active part of the oscillator is designed and fabricated in a 180 nm CMOS technology. By adding the parasitic effects of the assembly, taken from measurements of the submodules, the results from system simulation and measurement show good agreement, i.e. only 3 dB deviation in the noise floor of -142 dBc/Hz. The phase-noise level of the oscillator at an offset of 1kHz from the operating frequency of 256 MHz is -112 dBc/Hz, among the lowest values reported for MEMS-based oscillators at this high frequency.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0502143},
	abstract = {Time, and equivalently frequency, is the most precisely measured physical quantity. It is therefore inevitable that virtually all domains of engineering and physics need reference oscillators. The oscillator noise can be decomposed into amplitude noise and phase noise. The latter, far more important, affects timing, for it is related to precision and accuracy of measurements. The oscillator, inherently, turns the phase noise of the internal parts into frequency noise. This is a necessary consequence of the Barkhausen condition, which states that the loop gain must be of one, with zero phase, for stationary oscillation. There follows that oscillator phase noise, which is the integral of the frequency noise, diverges in the long run. This is the Leeson effect. The topics covered can be divided into three parts. Chapter 1 addresses language and general physical mechanisms. Chapter 2 aims at understanding the inside of commercial oscillators through the analysis of the specifications. Chapter 3 and 4 focus on the use of the Laplace transform to describe the oscillator and its phase noise. Since spring 2004, I had the opportunity to give some seminars on noise in oscillators at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, at the IEEE Frequency Control Symposium, at the FEMTO-ST Laboratory, and at the Universite' Henri Poincare'. These seminars had the purpose to provide a TUTORIAL, as opposed to a report on advanced science, addressed to a variety of people including technicians, PhD students, and senior scientists. This booklet derives from these seminars, and from numerous discussions with colleagues.},

	abstract = {In order to achieve the prediction of the phase noise of low phase noise crystal oscillator, based on the classic phase noise model of Leeson, the load Q value (QL) is calculated according to the selected oscillator circuit parameters. Thus, on the basis of Lesson phase noise formula, the predicted results of the phase noise of low phase noise crystal oscillators are obtained. Then, the nonlinear transistor model is constructed to simulate the phase noise of low phase noise crystal oscillator by using the ADS (Advanced Design System) simulation software of Agilent and obtain the simulated curve of the phase noise. At last, practical measurement has been performed on these low phase noise crystal oscillator prototypes. The measured results show that: the predicted phase noise of the oscillators and the ADS simulation results obtained by using nonlinear transistor model are both close to the actual measured phase noise, which are at 100Hz and far away offset the carrier frequency. After that, the existence of the deviation, which is near carrier frequency, is analyzed. The prediction and simulation methods given by this paper might be beneficial to simplify the design progress of the low phase noise crystal oscillator.},

The differential Colpitts structure exhibits a phase noise 6.5 dB lower than the single-ended structure because of its good performance of power noise immunity. Comparison between the two structures is also carried out. The differential Colpitts structure shows a phase noise level of -87 dBc/Hz at 1-kHz offset frequency and a phase noise floor of -162 dBc/Hz, with an output power close to -6.5 dBm and a core consumption of 21.6 mW. Furthermore, with the proposed optimization methods, both proposed devices have achieved promising phase noise performance compared with state-of-the-art oscillators described in the literature.

This new approach also elucidates several previously unknown design criteria for reducing close-in phase noise by identifying the mechanisms by which intrinsic device noise and external noise sources contribute to the total phase noise. In particular, it explains the details of how 1=f noise in a device upconverts into close-in phase noise and identiﬁes methods to suppress this upconversion. The theory also naturally accommodates cyclostationary noise sources, leading to additional important design insights. The model reduces to previously available phase noise models as special cases.

Part of the difficulty is that device noise undergoes multiple frequency translations to become oscillator phase noise. A quantitative understanding of this process requires abandoning the principle of time invariance assumed in most older theories of phase noise. Fortunately, the noise-to-phase transfer function of oscillators is still linear, despite the existence of the nonlinearities necessary for amplitude stabilization. In addition to providing a quantitative reconciliation between theory and measurement, the time-varying phase noise model presented in this tutorial identifies the importance of symmetry in suppressing the upconversion of 1/f noise into close-in phase noise, and provides an explicit appreciation of cyclostationary effects and AM-PM conversion. These insights allow a reinterpretation of why the Colpitts oscillator exhibits good performance, and suggest new oscillator topologies. Tuned LC and ring oscillator circuit examples are presented to reinforce the theoretical considerations developed. Simulation issues and the accommodation of amplitude noise are considered in appendixes.},

Therefore, in the design of high performance frequency synthesizers using Phase Locked Loops (PLL), the Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO) has become a key issue. The trend towards monolithic Integration poses some major challenges. This paper discusses the phase noise aspects of LC-tuned oscillators. A general formula is developed, based on the concepts of effective resistance and capacitance. The formula also applies for oscillators using active inductors. From these results the importance of an inductor with very low series resistance is apparent. To circumvent the technological limits given by an Inductor's series resistance, a presented enhanced LC-tank can be used to make a trade-off between noise and power.},

A large pool of Q values (ranging from 150 to 1400) is obtained by tuning the anchor loss amount via design. Then, we use top bench discrete components to create a Pierce oscillator, where the resonator is contacted directly with RF probes, enabling fast phase noise measurement on a large number of CMRs. Our results are in agreement with the Leeson's model (phase noise decreases when higher Q resonators are used) and show that the best PN, measured at highest Q =1413, is -100 dBc/Hz at 1 kHz offset frequency. Moreover, we compare this result to an aluminum nitride (AlN) CMR with nearly identical Q and find that the AlScN oscillator PN is 10 dBc/Hz better than the AlN oscillator at 1 kHz offset frequency.},

In particular, micromechanical RF filters and reference oscillators based on recently demonstrated vibrating on-chip micromechanical resonators with Q's {\textgreater} 10,000 at 1.5 GHz are described as an attractive solution to the increasing count of RF components (e.g., filters) expected to be needed by future multiband, multimode wireless devices. With Q's this high in on-chip abundance, such devices might also enable a paradigm shift in the design of timing and frequency control functions, where the advantages of high-Q are emphasized, rather than suppressed (e.g., due to size and cost reasons), resulting in enhanced robustness and power savings. Indeed, as vibrating RF MEMS devices are perceived more as circuit building blocks than as stand-alone devices, and as the frequency processing circuits they enable become larger and more complex, the makings of an integrated micromechanical circuit technology begin to take shape, perhaps with a functional breadth not unlike that of integrated transistor circuits. With even more aggressive three-dimensional MEMS technologies, even higher on-chip Q's are possible, such as already achieved via chip-scale atomic physics packages, which so far have achieved Q's {\textgreater} 107 using atomic cells measuring only 10 mm3 in volume and consuming just 5 mW of power, all while still allowing atomic clock Allan deviations down to 10-11 at one hour},

	abstract = {Transmission surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors are widely used in various fields of application. In order to improve the limit of detection (LOD) of such sensor systems, it is essential to understand and quantify the relevant noise sources. Only then, strategies for noise reduction can be developed. In this paper, low noise readout systems for the application with SAW sensors in open-loop and closed-loop configurations are presented and experimentally investigated with regard to their phase noise on the example of a SAW delay line magnetic field sensor. Besides a comprehensive analysis of the phase- and frequency modulated signals, respectively, previously derived equations in a theoretic study for describing the LOD of both readout structures are utilized in the experimental context. According to the theory, the same LOD is also obtained in the experiment for all frequencies for which the noise contributions of the readout electronics are negligible. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental study that directly compares both operating modes for the same sensor and in terms of the overall achievable LOD. The results are applicable to all kinds of phase-sensitive delay-line sensors.},

It combines the strong influence of past events on the future and, hence somewhat predictable behavior, with the influence of random events. Nonstationary autocorrelation functions for 1/f noise are developed to demonstrate that its present behavior is equally correlated with both the recent and distant past. The minimum amount of memory for a system that exhibits 1/f noise is shown to be one state variable per decade of frequency. The system condenses its past history into the present values of its state variables, one of which represents an average over the most recent 1 unit of time, one for the last 10 time units, 100 units, 1000, 10000, and so on.

The question of how the stabilities of such resonators scale with dimensions is examined in this paper, with emphasis on the noise characteristics. When the dimensions of a resonator become small, instabilities that are negligible in macro-scale devices become prominent. The effects of fluctuations in temperature, adsorbing/desorbing molecules, outgassing, Brownian motion, Johnson noise, drive power and self-heating, and random vibration are explored. When the device is small, the effects of fluctuations in the numbers of photons, phonons, electrons and adsorbed molecules can all affect the noise characteristics. For all but the random vibration-induced noise, reducing the dimensions increases the noise. At submicron dimensions, especially, the frequency noise due to temperature fluctuations, Johnson noise, and adsorption/desorption are likely to limit the applications of ultra-small resonators.},

The oscillator effectively removes the shunt capacitance Co, allowing the true series resonance to be monitored, providing the optimum sensitivity across a wide range of frequencies (i.e. kilohertz to gigahertz), shunt capacitances, and quality factors (Q) for the first time. It is wellknown that non-zero shunt capacitance alters the impedance by shifting the location of the impedance minimum and the zerophase crossing while causing significant impedance distortion. We have developed an active shunt capacitance cancelling oscillator (ASSCO) that removes any shunt capacitance across the resonator by supplying the circuit an equal “dummy” capacitance from a cancelling current. The oscillator does not require automatic gain control (AGC) and the resonator can be grounded to reduce parasitic contributions.},

Over 70 oscillator configurations are tested using resonators with different Q and with different piezoelectric layer. The testing of so many devices is possible because, in our setup, interfacing the circuit to the resonator is streamlined using RF probes. Our results show that higher resonator Q yields better frequency stability of the oscillator, for both AlN and AlScN CMRs. Interestingly, the comparison between AlN-based oscillators and AlScN-based oscillators with equal Q shows that AlScN-based oscillators' Phase Noise is up 10 dBc/Hz better than the AlN oscillator at 1 kHz offset frequency, suggesting different intrinsic resonator flicker noise of the two piezoelectric layers.},

Passive temperature compensation scheme is also conducted in the proposed CMOS-MEMS resonator by an oxide-metal composite structure, showing a low temperature coefficient of frequency (TC f ) of only +5.1 ppm/°C, which is suited for the use in ovenized oscillator systems. By implementing a constant-resistance temperature control scheme, the frequency drift of the resonator smaller than 120 ppm from -40 °C to 85 °C is demonstrated in this paper, indicating an equivalent TC f smaller than 1 ppm/°C, a record-low value against its CMOSMEMS counterparts. The CMOS-MEMS oscillator operating at 1.2 MHz demonstrates a phase noise of -112 dBc/Hz at 1-kHz offset and -120 dBc/Hz at 1-MHz offset while drawing less than 1.3 mW. The entire power consumption of the ovenized oscillator system is confirmed to be less than 1.8 mW (oscillator + micro-oven), verifying the great potential of low power oven-controlled MEMS oscillators realized in CMOS-MEMS technology.},

	abstract = {For the development of mobile communication systems of fifth generation (5G) a number of frequency bands are currently proposed in Russian Federation. Since the 5G standard does not yet exist and the requirements for 5G systems are very wide, a detailed analysis is needed to select the frequency band for 5G networks. The article presents the main problems that should be solved in order to implement 5G and whether its requirements can be achieved in the recommended frequency bands. Evaluation of the possibility of using each band was made with regard to the corresponding problems, system goals and link budget estimation. MmWaves may be recommended for the stationary network devices, while for mobile services it is proposed to use frequencies below 6 GHz.},
